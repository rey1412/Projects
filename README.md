Data Visualization enables decision-makers in any business or industry to examine analytical reports and comprehend concepts that would otherwise be difficult to grasp in today's Big Data era across this work, I designed a dashboard for hotel reservations across Europe. This dashboard displays Customer Preferences for booking hotels and making trips, which primarily include types of trips, types of rooms purchased, travel companion, average hotel score, customer nationality, and destination selection. I picked PowerBI to analyze this dataset because it is quite versatile and provides a range of choices for analyzing and visualizing the data.
